              <h2>What is SSL?</h2>
              
                <p>
                  SSL is a technology that encodes information shared on the web between a website 
                  and a browser, so that it is more difficult to intercept. It stands for Secure 
                  Sockets Layer. It is also called TSL, which stands for Transport Layer security. 
                  SSL and TLS are the same thing in principle, but TLS is the more updated version of
                  SSL, so it is reccommended you use TLS.
                </p>

              <h2>What is HTTPS?</h2>
                
                <p>
                  HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP, which stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol.
                  The 'S' in 'HTTPS' stands for 'Secure'. HTTPS uses TLS or SSL to secure
                  and encrypt normal HTTP requests and responses, such as forms or sign-ins. 
                </p>

              <h2>How can i tell if my website is secure?</h2>
                <p>
                  You can tell if your website is secure by checking the top URL and checking if it
                  is HTTPS or HTTP. If it is HTTP, you are not secure, and anything you enter on the
                  website is not encrypted. If it is HTTPS, then your information is encrypted, and
                  it will be a lot harder to intercept. 
                </p>

              <h2>What is an SSL certificate authority?</h2>

                <p>
                  An SSL certificate authority is a trusted company that can provide SSL 
                  certificates to people who need security on websites. Some web providers are
                  allowed to do this, so in a lot of cases, you will not need to worry about this if
                  you already have a DNS provider.
